# final_project
implementation of the basic Dyna-q for the solution of the problem

Update: used the professor valid action method.

Update: improved the plotting part as well as the algorithm itself

Update: joined the Q-factors and the model in a single data structure, also implemented the prioritized sweeping

Update: functions compacted/optimized

Update: modified the data structure to grow while we explore new state/actions, moreover moved to the dyna-q+

Update: found an error, i was modifing the model even in simulation, instead of updating the Q
